wizard_title=Post-Installation Wizard
wizard_ecannot=You are not allowed to run the post-installation wizard
wizard_next=Next
wizard_prev=Previous
wizard_cancel=Cancel
wizard_title_intro=Introduction
wizard_intro=This post-installation wizard allows you to configure Virtualmin optimally for your system. You can make selections depending on whether you want to host websites, email or databases, and based on your system's memory and CPU power.<p>To continue, click the <b>Next</b> button below. To skip it and use the default settings, click <b>Cancel</b>.
wizard_title_memory=Memory use
wizard_memory=Virtualmin can be tuned to improve performance in its user interface and email processing, but at the cost of increased memory use. The best choice depends on how your system will be used.
wizard_memory_preload=Preload Virtualmin libraries?
wizard_memory_preload1=Yes (more RAM used, faster Virtualmin UI - approximately $1)
wizard_memory_preload0=No (less RAM used, slower UI and more CPU load)
wizard_memory_lookup=Run email domain lookup server?
wizard_memory_lookup1=Yes (more RAM used, faster mail processing - approximately $1)
wizard_memory_lookup0=No (less RAM used, slower mail and more CPU load)
wizard_virusnew=If your system is going to host domains that will receive a large amount of email, scanning incoming messages for viruses can generate high CPU load. Because scanning is done using the ClamAV scanning server <tt>clamd</tt>, it will consume RAM even when not processing email. If your system will not be hosting email, virus scanning can be disabled.
wizard_virusmsg=Enable virus scanning with ClamAV?
wizard_virus1=Yes (uses approximately 750 MB RAM)
wizard_virus2=Keep using on-demand scanner
wizard_virus0=No (email will not be filtered)
wizard_clamdnone=However, Virtualmin does not know how to enable the ClamAV server scanner on your system. You will need to set it up manually.
wizard_eclamdenable=Failed to start the ClamAV server scanner. Try enabling it on the <b>Spam and Virus Scanning</b> page to see a more detailed error message.
wizard_eclamdtest=A problem occurred testing the ClamAV server scanner : $1
wizard_eclaminuse=Virus scanning cannot be disabled as it is in use by $1 virtual servers
wizard_spam=If your system is going to host domains that will receive a large amount of email, filtering incoming messages for spam can generate significant CPU load. This is due to CPU use by the SpamAssassin mail filter when it is started, which can be avoided by running the SpamAssassin filter server <tt>spamd</tt> in the background. This consumes RAM, but reduces CPU load and makes mail processing faster.
wizard_title_spam=Spam filtering
wizard_spamd=Run SpamAssassin server filter?
wizard_spamd1=Yes (more RAM used, faster mail processing, no per-domain settings - approximately 30M)
wizard_spamd0=No (less RAM used, slower mail processing)
wizard_spamdnone=However, the SpamAssassin server <tt>spamd</tt> is not installed on your system. You will need to install it first and then enable it on the <b>Spam and Virus Scanning</b> page.
wizard_espamdenable=Failed to start the SpamAssassin server filter. Try enabling it on the <b>Spam and Virus Scanning</b> page to see a more detailed error message.
wizard_title_db=Database servers
wizard_db=Virtualmin supports both the MySQL and PostgreSQL database servers, but you might want to run only one (or neither) on your system. Each consumes RAM when running, even if they are not being used.<p>Depending on the websites and applications you plan to host, running MySQL only may be enough, as most web applications do not support or require PostgreSQL. If your system will only be used for mail or DNS hosting, there is no need to run either.
wizard_db_mysql=Run MySQL database server?
wizard_db_mysql1=Yes (more RAM used, needed for most non-static websites)
wizard_db_mysql0=No (less RAM used)
wizard_db_postgres=Run PostgreSQL database server?
wizard_db_postgres1=Yes (more RAM used, needed for some web applications)
wizard_db_postgres0=No (less RAM used)
wizard_emysqlinst=MySQL cannot be enabled, as it is not installed on your system
wizard_emysqlconf=MySQL has been enabled, but cannot be used by Virtualmin. Use the <a href='$1'>MySQL Database</a> module to fix the problem.
wizard_emysqlstart=An error occurred starting MySQL : $1
wizard_epostgresinst=PostgreSQL cannot be enabled, as it is not installed on your system
wizard_epostgresconf=PostgreSQL has been enabled, but cannot be used by Virtualmin. Use the <a href='$1'>PostgreSQL Database</a> module to fix the problem.
wizard_epostgresstart=An error occurred starting PostgreSQL : $1
wizard_title_mysql=MySQL password
wizard_mysql=To prevent other users on your system from managing the MySQL database, a password for the <tt>root</tt> user should be set.
wizard_mysql2=Currently the MySQL password is not set, which is highly insecure.
wizard_mysql3=This has already been done, so changing the password here is not mandatory.
wizard_mysql4=Virtualmin does not not know what the current MySQL <tt>root</tt> password is. It must be set here to allow Virtualmin to create new MySQL databases and users.
wizard_mysql_pass=Change MySQL password
wizard_mysql_pass1=Leave un-changed
wizard_mysql_pass0=Set to
wizard_mysql_empty=Set MySQL password
wizard_mysql_forcepass=Override the <tt>root</tt> MySQL password to match
wizard_mysql_deltest=Remove <tt>test</tt> MySQL database?
wizard_mysql_delc=(Contains $1 tables)
wizard_mysql_delanon=Remove anonymous MySQL user?
wizard_mysql_epass=Incorrect MySQL password
wizard_title_mysize=MySQL database size
wizard_mysize=MySQL can be configured to trade off memory use for performance, depending on how much RAM your system has and how heavily you expect the database to be used.
wizard_mysize_type=MySQL configuration size
wizard_mysize_def=Leave default settings
wizard_mysize_small=Small system (256M) with infrequent MySQL use
wizard_mysize_medium=Medium system (512M) with regular MySQL use
wizard_mysize_large=Large system (1G) on which MySQL is heavily used
wizard_mysize_huge=Huge system (2G or more) on which MySQL is heavily used
wizard_myrec=(RECOMMENDED)
wizard_emysizestart=MySQL could not be started with the new configuration : $1. The old configuration has been restored.
wizard_title_done=All done
wizard_done=Virtualmin post-installation configuration is now complete!
wizard_title_dns=DNS configuration
wizard_dns=For DNS zones created by Virtualmin to be resolvable, the primary nameserver record for each zone must be set to something that can itself be resolved by other systems on the Internet.
wizard_dns_prins=Primary nameserver
wizard_dns_secns=Secondary nameservers (optional)
wizard_dns_eprins=Primary nameserver is not a valid DNS name
wizard_dns_eprins2=Primary nameserver cannot be resolved on this system
wizard_dns_eprins3=Primary nameserver cannot be resolved from the rest of the Internet : $1
wizard_dns_esecns=Secondary nameserver $1 is not a valid DNS name
wizard_dns_esecns2=Secondary nameserver $1 cannot be resolved on this system
wizard_dns_esecns3=Secondary nameserver $1 cannot be resolved from the rest of the Internet : $2
wizard_dns_skip=Skip check for resolvability
wizard_title_hashpass=Password storage 
wizard_hashpass=Virtualmin gives you the option of storing plain-text passwords for virtual servers and mailboxes, or storing only one-way encrypted (hashed) passwords. Plain text passwords are more convenient, but less secure if your system is compromised.
wizard_hashpass_mode=Password storage mode
wizard_hashpass_mode1=Only store hashed passwords
wizard_hashpass_mode0=Store plain-text passwords
wizard_hashpass_warn=Warning - when hashed passwords are used, password recovery for virtual servers will no longer be possible. In addition, the MySQL password for new servers will be different from the administration password, and will be randomly generated.
wizard_defdom=Virtualmin can create a default virtual server that will serve web requests to your system that don't match any other domain. It can also be used to request a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for use by Virtualmin's own UI.
wizard_defdom_exists=A default virtual server named $1 has already been created. You will need to delete it before this page can be used to create a new default.
wizard_defdom_mode=Setup default virtual server?
wizard_defdom0=No, thanks
wizard_defdom1=Create server with domain
wizard_defdom_ssl=Enable SSL on default server?
wizard_defssl0=No
wizard_defssl1=Yes, with self-signed certificate

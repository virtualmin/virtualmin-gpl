So that the logs do not need to be kept around forever and continually re-read, the number of bytes used per feature per day is computed and stored separately by Virtualmin.
bwreset_desc2=This form can be used to force the re-scanning of the original log files for traffic from the selected date onwards. This can be useful if your logs were incorrect or partially missing, or if a change or fix was made to the way Virtualmin counts traffic.

postgrey_desc=Greylist is a technique to reduce spam by initially rejecting email the first time another mail server tries to contact your server. Real mail servers will re-try after a short delay, but those operated by spammers typically will not. Thus legitimate email still gets delivered, but spam does not.

wizard_title=Post-Installation Wizard
wizard_ecannot=You are not allowed to run the post-installation wizard
wizard_next=Next
wizard_finish=Finish
wizard_prev=Previous
wizard_cancel=Cancel
wizard_end=Return to Virtualmin
wizard_title_intro=Introduction
wizard_intro=This post-installation wizard allows you to configure Virtualmin optimally for your system. You can make selections depending on whether you want to host websites, email or databases, and based on your system's memory and CPU power.<p>To continue, click the <b>Next</b> button below. To skip it and use the default settings, click <b>Cancel</b>.
wizard_title_memory=Memory use
wizard_memory2=Virtualmin can be tuned to improve performance in its email processing, but at the cost of increased memory use. The best choice depends on how your system will be used.
wizard_memory_lookup=Run email domain lookup server?
wizard_memory_lookup1=Yes, faster mail processing with more RAM used (≈$1)
wizard_memory_lookup0=No, slower mail processing with less RAM used, but more CPU load
wizard_virusnew=If your system is going to host domains that will receive a large amount of email, scanning incoming messages for viruses can generate high CPU load. Because scanning is done using the ClamAV scanning server <tt>clamd</tt>, it will consume RAM even when not processing email. If your system will not be hosting email, virus scanning can be disabled.
wizard_virusmsg=Enable virus scanning with ClamAV?
wizard_virus1=Yes, uses up to 2G of RAM
wizard_virus2=Keep using on-demand scanner
wizard_virus0=No, email will not be filtered
wizard_clamdnone=However, Virtualmin does not know how to enable the ClamAV server scanner on your system. You will need to set it up manually.
wizard_eclamdenable=Failed to start the ClamAV server scanner. Try enabling it on the <b>Spam and Virus Scanning</b> page to see a more detailed error message.
wizard_eclamdtest=A problem occurred testing the ClamAV server scanner : $1
wizard_eclaminuse=Virus scanning cannot be disabled as it is in use by $1 virtual servers
wizard_spam=If your system is going to host domains that will receive a large amount of email, filtering incoming messages for spam can generate significant CPU load. This is due to CPU use by the SpamAssassin mail filter when it is started, which can be avoided by running the SpamAssassin filter server <tt>spamd</tt> in the background. This consumes RAM, but reduces CPU load and makes mail processing faster.
wizard_title_spam=Spam filtering
wizard_spamd=Run SpamAssassin server filter?
wizard_spamd1=Yes, faster mail processing with more RAM used (≈30M) and no per-domain settings
wizard_spamd0=No, slower mail processing with less RAM used
wizard_spamdnone=However, the SpamAssassin server <tt>spamd</tt> is not installed on your system. You will need to install it first and then enable it on the <b>Spam and Virus Scanning</b> page.
wizard_espamdenable=Failed to start the SpamAssassin server filter. Try enabling it on the <b>Spam and Virus Scanning</b> page to see a more detailed error message.
wizard_title_db=Database servers
wizard_db=Virtualmin supports both the MySQL and PostgreSQL database servers, but you might want to run only one (or neither) on your system. Each consumes RAM when running, even if they are not being used.<p>Depending on the websites and applications you plan to host, running MySQL only may be enough, as most web applications do not support or require PostgreSQL. If your system will only be used for mail or DNS hosting, there is no need to run either.
wizard_db_mysql=Run MySQL database server?
wizard_db_postgres=Run PostgreSQL database server?
wizard_emysqlinst=MySQL cannot be enabled, as it is not installed on your system
wizard_emysqlconf=MySQL has been enabled, but cannot be used by Virtualmin. Use the <a href='$1'>MySQL Database</a> module to fix the problem.
wizard_emysqlstart=An error occurred starting MySQL : $1
wizard_epostgresinst=PostgreSQL cannot be enabled, as it is not installed on your system
wizard_epostgresconf=PostgreSQL has been enabled, but cannot be used by Virtualmin. Use the <a href='$1'>PostgreSQL Database</a> module to fix the problem.
wizard_epostgresstart=An error occurred starting PostgreSQL : $1
wizard_title_mysql=MySQL password
wizard_mysql=To prevent other users on your system from managing the MySQL database, a password for the <tt>root</tt> user should be set.
wizard_mysql2=Currently the MySQL password is not set, which is highly insecure.
wizard_mysql3=This has already been done, so changing the password here is not mandatory.
wizard_mysql4=Virtualmin does not not know what the current MySQL <tt>root</tt> password is. It must be set here to allow Virtualmin to create new MySQL databases and users.
wizard_mysql5=In this installation of MySQL, the <tt>root</tt> user is set up to authenticate via Unix socket authentication, which bypasses the need for a password. This setup prevents the <tt>root</tt> user from logging into web-based database management tools like phpMyAdmin, which rely on password authentication. However, it's important to note that regular MySQL users, who are configured with password-based authentication, can still access and authenticate in web tools like phpMyAdmin using their assigned passwords.
wizard_mysql_pass=Change MySQL password
wizard_mysql_pass1=Leave un-changed
wizard_mysql_pass2=Leave Unix socket authentication for the <tt>root</tt> user
wizard_mysql_pass0=Set to
wizard_mysql_empty=Set MySQL password
wizard_mysql_forcepass=Override the <tt>root</tt> MySQL password to match
wizard_mysql_deltest=Remove <tt>test</tt> MySQL database?
wizard_mysql_delc=(Contains $1 tables)
wizard_mysql_delanon=Remove anonymous MySQL user?
wizard_mysql_epass=Incorrect MySQL password
wizard_myrec=(SUGGESTED)
wizard_title_done=All done
wizard_done=Virtualmin post-installation configuration is now complete!
wizard_done2=However, you can continue with the wizard to configure optional features.
wizard_alldone=Additional post-installation configuration is now complete!
wizard_title_dns=DNS configuration
wizard_dns=For DNS zones created by Virtualmin to be resolvable, the primary nameserver record for each zone must be set to something that can itself be resolved by other systems on the Internet.
wizard_dns_prins=Primary nameserver
wizard_dns_secns=Additional nameservers (optional)
wizard_etmpl0=Default template does not exist!
wizard_dns_eprins=Primary nameserver is not a valid DNS name
wizard_dns_eprins2=Primary nameserver cannot be resolved on this system
wizard_dns_eprins3=Primary nameserver cannot be resolved from the rest of the Internet : $1
wizard_dns_esecns=Additional nameserver $1 is not a valid DNS name
wizard_dns_esecns2=Additional nameserver $1 cannot be resolved on this system
wizard_dns_esecns3=Additional nameserver $1 cannot be resolved from the rest of the Internet : $2
wizard_dns_skip=Skip check for resolvability
wizard_title_hashpass=Password storage
wizard_hashpass=Virtualmin gives you the option of storing plain-text passwords for virtual servers and mailboxes, or storing only one-way encrypted (hashed) passwords. Plain text passwords are more convenient, but less secure if your system is compromised.
wizard_hashpass_mode=Password storage mode
wizard_hashpass_mode1=Only store hashed passwords
wizard_hashpass_mode0=Store plain-text passwords
wizard_hashpass_warn=However, with hashed passwords enabled, password recovery for virtual servers will not be not possible, and database password for new servers will be different from the administration password, and will be randomly generated.
wizard_title_ssldir=SSL key directory
wizard_ssldir=Virtualmin gives you the option of keeping SSL certificates and keys in each virtual server's home directory, or another location under <tt>/etc</tt>. The former is easier to manage, but introduces the risk that server owners may cause your webserver to fail to start if they delete the certificate file.
wizard_ssldir_mode=Location for SSL certificates
wizard_ssldir_mode0=In each domain's home directory
wizard_ssldir_mode1=Per-domain directory under $1
wizard_ssldir_mode2=Custom key file template
wizard_ssldir_mode3=Existing custom location
wizard_essldir=Missing custom key file template
wizard_title_email=System email address
wizard_email_desc=Email notifications sent by Virtualmin will come from the address you set on this page. It is recommended that this address forward or deliver email to a person, so that replies to system email messages will be read.
wizard_from_addr=Master administrator's email address
wizard_from_addr2=Your address
wizard_efrom_addr=Email address must be in user@domain format

bwreset_desc=Virtualmin generates the bandwidth statistics shown in its graphs by scanning the web, FTP and mail log files for each virtual server. So that the logs do not need to be kept around forever and continually re-read, the number of bytes used per feature per day is computed and stored separately by Virtualmin.
bwreset_desc2=This form can be used to force the re-scanning of the original log files for traffic from the selected date onwards. This can be useful if your logs were incorrect or partially missing, or if a change or fix was made to the way Virtualmin counts traffic.
bwreset_desc3=<b>Warning</b> - this should be done with care, as it may cause bandwidth usage data to be lost if log files no longer exist for the date range you select.

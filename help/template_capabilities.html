<header>Default editing capabilities</header>

These checkboxes determine which capabilities of their virtual servers
domain owners can edit by default. Once a server is created, these can
be changed on the Edit Owner Limits page. <p>

If the <b>Automatic</b> option is selected, limits are determined based on
whether the virtual server owner is allowed to create sub-servers or not
(controlled by the <b>Limit on number of virtual servers</b> field). If so,
he will have access to all capabilities. Otherwise, he can only manage users,
aliases and edit web pages. <p>

The available options are :

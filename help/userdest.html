<header>Email forwarding destinations</header>

This table of fields determines what happens to email sent to this user.
Normally it would just be delivered directly to the user's mailbox, but if
any desintations are defined here then they will be used instead. This can
be used to setup an autoresponder if the user is away on vacation, or to
forward his email to an address on another server. <p>

Each destination has a type (chosen from the menu), which can be one of the
following :
<ul>
<li><b>Email address</b><br>
    Email will be forwarded to the address entered in the adjacent field.<p>
<li><b>Addresses in file</b><br>
    Email will be forwarded to all of the addresses listed in the text file
    whose path is entered in the adjacent field.<p>
<li><b>Write to file</b><br>
    Email to the alias will appended to the specified file. All headers and
    the raw un-decoded body will be included.<p>
<li><b>Feed to program</b><br>
    The program entered in the adjacent field will be executed and email to
    the alias passed to it as input. <p>
<li><b>Autoreply from file</b><br>
    When email is received by the user, and automatic reply message will be
    sent back to the sender. The text of this autoreply will be taken from the
    file entered in the adjacent text field. <p>
<li><b>Apply filter file</b><br>
    Email sent to the user will be processed according to the rules in the
    specified filter file, which may cause it to be forwarded to other
    addresses or files depending on the actual contents of the message. <p>
<li><b>Mailbox of user</b><br>
    Email will be delivered directly to the mailbox of the user entered in
    the adjacent text field. Typically you would enter the name of the
    user himself, so that he receives a copy of the email as well as it being
    forwarded to any other destinations. However, you must enter the full POP3
    login username, like <i>joe.foo</i> instead of just <i>joe</i>.<p>
</ul>
If you choose the <b>Addresses in file</b>, <b>Autoreply from file</b> or
<b>Apply filter file</b> destination types, when you re-edit
the users links labelled <b>Edit..</b> will appear next to any such destinations
for editing the contents of the specified file. <p>

<header>Create extra Unix user on Postfix systems when using user@domain format?</header>

When using user@domain-format Unix usernames and the Postfix mail server,
Virtalmin will when this option is set to yes (the default) create an additonal
user-domain format Unix user to facilitate mail delivery. However, on some
systems this is not necessary, and so you can use this option to turn off that
feature. It will only apply to newly created users and domains though. <p>

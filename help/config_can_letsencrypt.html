<header>Who can request Let's Encrypt certificates?</header>

This option determines if domain owners, resellers or only the <tt>root</tt>
user can request Let's Encrypt certificates. If you allow more than just
<tt>root</tt> to request certs, be aware that they will be under a single
Let's Encrypt account that is associated with your Virtualmin system. <p>

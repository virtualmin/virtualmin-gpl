<header>Additional MySQL servers to create users on</header>

By default, Virtualmin will create all MySQL account and permissions on a
single MySQL server, typically the one running on the same machine as
Virtualmin itself. However, if you are running multiple servers with replication
or the NDBCluster system, you may need Virtualmin to create these permissions
on several servers. This will allow domain owners to login to any one of them.
<p>

To set this up, enter a space-separated list of additional servers 
into this field. Virtual servers created from now on will be added to the
masystem, and to those in the list. Existing virtual servers will not be added
though. <p>

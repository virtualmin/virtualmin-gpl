<header>PHP script execution mode</header>

This option determines if PHP scripts are run as the Apache web server user
(typically <tt>httpd</tt> or <tt>apache</tt>), or the Unix user who owns
the virtual server. The former is faster as it means that no additional
processes need to be started to execute PHP code, but less secure as scripts
read and write files as a user other than the domain owner. <p>

If your system supports it, the <b>FPM</b> or <b>FCGId</b> options are the best,
as they run PHP scripts quickly and as the domain owner. Otherwise, unless your
system is heavily loaded or security between users is not an issue, the
<b>CGI wrapper</b> option is recommended. <p>

The <tt>mod_php</tt> mode is not recommended, as the small gain in performance
should be balanced against the lack of security between virtual servers.
Finally, the <b>Disabled</b> mode can be used to turn off PHP scripts entirely.

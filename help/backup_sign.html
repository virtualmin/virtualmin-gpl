<header>Also sign encrypted backup?</header>

If a backup encryption key is selected, this checkbox controls if it is also
digitally signed. Creating a signature will cause the backup to take longer
and consume more CPU time, but can ensure that it has not been tampered with
if written to off-site storage that you do not have control over. Also, only
signed backups can be restored by domain owners. <p>

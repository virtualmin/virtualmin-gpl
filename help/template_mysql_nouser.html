<header>Keep MySQL and administration usernames in sync?</header>

By default, Virtualmin will change the MySQL login for a domain when
the administration login changes. Howver, this will cause problems for
any installed applications that have already been configured with the old
username. To avoid this, change this setting to <b>No</b>. <p>

<header>Preload Virtualmin libraries at startup?</header>

In order to speed up the performance of the CGI scripts that make up Virtualmin,
Webmin can be configured to load some of their Perl libraries into memory at
startup time so that they do not have to be read from disk and parsed for
every request. However this uses up more RAM - approximately 100M on a typical
Linux system. <p>

This setting gives you more control over how much pre-loading is done. The
options are :
<dl>
<dt><b>All libraries</b>
<dd>Libraries for all Webmin modules and plugins used by Virtualmin are loaded.
    The Webmin server process will consume approximately 100M of RAM.

<dt><b>Only core</b>
<dd>Only those libraries that are part of Virtualmin itself are loaded.
    The Webmin server process will use around 50M of RAM.

<dt><b>No</b>
<dd>Nothing is pre-loaded - instead, all libraries are loaded on demand.
    The Webmin server process will use only 15M of RAM.

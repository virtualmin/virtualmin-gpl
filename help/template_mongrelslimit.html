<header>Default limit on number of Mongrel instances</header>

When installing Ruby on Rails scripts, the server administrator can select
how my Mongrel server processes to start to handle requests to the script's
path - if the Apache <tt>mod_proxy_balancer</tt> module is installed. To
prevent an excessive number of Mongrel server processes from overloading the
system, this option can be used to set the default limit on the number that
domain administrators are allowed to configure from within Virtualmin. <p>

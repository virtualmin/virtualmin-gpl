<header>Resource Limits</header>

This page lets you control how much CPU, memory, and disk I/O a virtual server
owner can use. Limits apply to the Unix user that owns this virtual server and
all sub-servers, so they affect SSH logins, cron jobs, scripts, and most
server-side processes that run as that user. Virtualmin provides two types of
limits: user-based limits that use systemd user slices (cgroups v2) to cap total
usage across all processes, and process-based limits that use
<tt>limits.conf</tt> to restrict each individual process.<p></p>

The available user-based limit types are:
<ul>
<li><tt>CPUQuota</tt> and <tt>CPUWeight</tt> to cap CPU use and/or set CPU
priority compared to other users.</li>
<li><tt>MemoryMax</tt> to set a hard memory ceiling for all processes combined,
and <tt>MemoryHigh</tt> to start throttling memory use before the hard
limit.</li>
<li><tt>MemorySwapMax</tt> to limit how much swap (disk-backed memory) the
user’s processes can use.</li>
<li><tt>TasksMax</tt> to cap the total number of processes and threads.</li>
<li><tt>IOReadBandwidthMax</tt> / <tt>IOWriteBandwidthMax</tt> to cap disk
bandwidth, and <tt>IOReadIOPSMax</tt> / <tt>IOWriteIOPSMax</tt> to cap I/O
operations per second. These limits apply per block device.</li>
<li><tt>IOWeight</tt> to set disk I/O priority compared to other users.</li>
</ul>

The available process-based limit types are:
<ul>
<li>Maximum number of processes: prevents starting more processes than allowed
for the user.</li>
<li>Maximum size per process: kills any single process that exceeds the limit,
but does not cap total memory across all processes.</li>
<li>Maximum CPU time per process: kills any process whose CPU time exceeds the
limit.</li>
</ul>

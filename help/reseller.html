<header>Reseller Accounts</header>
A reseller is a login that can create new parent Virtualmin servers, subject to limits defined by the master administrator. Further limits can then be imposed on the total disk quota, mailboxes and databases that a reseller's servers can be allocated.  A reseller will have the ability to disable, upgrade, and reset passwords of the domains she manages, much like a master administrator account.

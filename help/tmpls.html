<header>Server Template</header>

A server template defines default settings for new domains, or for features
added to existing domains. Almost all of the text fields and boxes below allow
you to use variables which will be substituted based on the virtual server's
setting at the time the template is used. Some of the more useful variables
are :<p>
<table>
<tr> <td><tt><b>${DOM}</b></td>
<td>The domain name, such as <tt>foo.com</tt></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><tt><b>${PREFIX}</b></td>
<td>The first part of the domain name, like <tt>foo</tt></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><tt><b>${USER}</b></td>

<td>The user that owns the domain, such as <tt>foo</tt></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><tt><b>${IP}</b></td>
<td>The IP address assigned to the virtual server, such as <tt>192.168.1.1</tt></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><tt><b>${HOME}</b></td>
<td>The domain user's home directory, such as <tt>/home/foo</tt></td> </tr>

</table>
In addition, conditional blocks like <i>$IF-MAIL...$ENDIF-MAIL</i> and <i>$IF-WEB...$ELSE-WEB...{$ENDIF-WEB}</i> may be used.<p>

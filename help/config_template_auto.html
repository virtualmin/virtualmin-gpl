<header>Allow editing of options from template when creating server?</header>

When this option is set to <b>No</b>, all new virtual servers will always have their
quotas, bandwidth and other limits set to the defaults defined in the selected
server template. If set to <b>Yes</b>, the server creator will have the 
opportunity to change these settings on the creation form first before the
server is saved. The latter option is more flexible, but causes several
typically un-changed fields to appear on the creation page. <p>

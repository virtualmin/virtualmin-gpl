<header>Generate SSL certificate for domains without SSL enabled?</header>

By default Virtualmin will not create a SSL certicate for new virtual servers
unless they have the SSL feature enabled - however, a certificate can be added
later. When this option is enabled, all new domains will get a cert that can
be used by other services like Dovecot, Postfix or external SSL proxies. <p>

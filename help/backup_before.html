<header>Command to run before backup</header>

If set, the command or script entered will be run as <tt>root</tt> before
the backup is run on schedule. This can be useful for mounting removable
or remote filesystems to which the backup should be written. <p>

If the command fails (with a non-zero exit status), the rest of the backup
will not proceed. <p>

The command can discover information about the backup via environment variables
starting with <tt>BACKUP_</tt> , like:

<dl>
<dt><tt>BACKUP_DOMAIN_NAMES</tt>
<dd>Names of all the virtual servers being backed up.<p>

<dt><tt>BACKUP_DEST</tt>
<dd>The destination directory or URL.<p>

<dt><tt>BACKUP_FEATURES</tt>
<dd>Names of all Virtualmin features included in the backup. If <tt>BACKUP_ALL</tt> is set to 1, all features are included.<p>

</dl>

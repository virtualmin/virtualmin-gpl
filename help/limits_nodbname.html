<header>Can choose database names?</header>

If this restriction is set to <b>No</b>, the server owner will not be allowed
to select the default database name when creating a sub-server that has a 
database feature enabled. Instead, it will always default to the first part
of the domain name. <p>

In addition, he will not be able to remove the default database for any existing
domain, as this would allow him to effectively rename the default database
after domain creation. <p>

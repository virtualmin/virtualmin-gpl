<header>Protect phpMyAdmin with login and password</header>

When enabled, the <tt>.htaccess</tt> and <tt>.htpasswd</tt> files in the
installation directory are used to configure HTTP Basic Authentication for
phpMyAdmin. Users must authenticate before gaining access to phpMyAdmin. <p>

The username and password used correspond to the domain owner's credentials.
These credentials are separate from the MySQL/phpMyAdmin login that appears
after access is granted. <p>

This option can be enabled automatically only during installation time. <p>

<header>Update Virtual Servers</header>

This page allows you to update settings and limits in multiple virtual servers
at once, as selected on the previous page. By default, nothing will be changed
on the selected servers until you choose some attribute or limit to modify
using the fields on this page. Modifyable settings are broken down into
the following categories :<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Quota and bandwidth changes</b>
<dd>These fields can be used to modify the disk quotas for selected servers, or
    to change their bandwidth limits. Changing quotas only has an effect on
    top-level servers, as sub-servers inherit their quotas from the parent
    domain.<p>

<dt><b>Enabled feature changes</b>
<dd>In this section, you can select features to turn on or off for all of the
    selected servers. These are the same features that can be activated for
    individual servers on the <b>Edit Virtual Server</b> page.<p>

<dt><b>Changes to owner limits</b>
<dd>These fields can be used to change the various limits that apply to owners
    of top-level virtual servers, such as the number of mailboxes, aliases
    and domains they can create. Changes made here have no effect on
    sub-servers, which fall under the limits imposed on their parents.<p>

<dt><b>Changes to owner capabilities</b>
<dd>The fields in this section control the capabilities of Virtualmin that
    are available to the administrators of the selected virtual servers.
    Again, they are only relevant for top-level servers. <p>

<dt><b>Configuration changes</b>
<dd>This section is for making various changes to the configuration of selected
    servers, such as the method use for spam clearing or the domain
    administrator's login shell. <p>

</dl>

It is also possible to temporarily disable the selected servers using the
<b>Disable Servers</b> button at the bottom of the page. When using this,
you can also enter a reason for disabling (such as <i>non payment</i>) into
the adjacent text box. <p>

To re-enable multiple servers that have been disabled on this page or elsewhere,
use the <b>Enable Servers</b> button. <p>

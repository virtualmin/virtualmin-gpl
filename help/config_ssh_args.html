<header>Additonal parameters to ssh and scp commands</header>

When Virtualmin performs a remote backup or restore using SSH, it will use
the <tt>ssh</tt> and <tt>scp</tt> commands to transfer files. This field lets
you specify additional parameters for those commands, such as the 
<tt>-i</tt> flag followed by the path to an alternate SSH private key identity
file. <p>

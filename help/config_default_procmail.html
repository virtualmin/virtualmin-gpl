<header>Allow mailbox users to create mail filters?</header>

When this option is set to <b>No</b>, Procmail will be configured to not
execute the .procmailrc files in users' home directories, which prevents any
mail filters, autoresonders or forwards created by users from running. This has
some security benefits, as it prevents mailbox users from running commands
via Procmail. <p>

<header>Forward original HTTP hostname when proxying?</header>

When this option is set to <b>No</b> as it is by default, any backend HTTP
servers that receive proxied requests from this domain will not see the
original HTTP hostname. However, switch to <b>Yes</b> will cause the hostname
to be forwarded, which may be necessary for the backend application to
include it in HTML or email messages. <p>

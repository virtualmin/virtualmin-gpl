<header>Allow sub-servers under other users' domains?</header>

If <b>No</b> is selected for this option, the user will be prevented from
creating sub-domains that are under the domains belonging to other users.
For example, he would not be allowed to create <tt>foo.bar.com</tt> in 
Virtualmin if <tt>bar.com</tt> is registered and belongs to a different
user. <p>

<header>Command to run before making changes to a domain</header>
If you want to perform some action before altering a domain (creation, alteration, or deletion) you may specify a command to run here.  If multiple actions are to be performed the command to run can be a script.  The command has access to special environment variables specific to the domain, such as VIRTUALSERVER_DOM, VIRTUALSERVER_IP, VIRTUALSERVER_USER, VIRTUALSERVER_HOME, VIRTUALSERVER_PASS, and more.  Any variable found in the /etc/webmin/virtual-server/domains/$DOM file will be available as an environment variable.

<header>Maximum fcgid execution time</header>

By default, Virtualmin sets the maximum execution time for fastCGI processes
to match the execution time of PHP scripts, as determined by the domain's
<tt>php.ini</tt> file. This ensures that PHP applications will not run
for longer than they are supposed to. <p>

However, you can disable this behaviour by selecting <b>Don't set</b> in this
configuration field. Or you can specify your own timeout for fastCGI scripts
by selecting <b>Time in seconds</b> and entering a number. <p>

This is implemented by setting the Apache <tt>IPCCommTimeout</tt> directive, or
the equivalent in Nginx. <p>

<header>File patterns not to substitute</header>

If the <b>Substitute variables in contents?</b> option is set to <b>Yes</b>,
Virtualmin will replace variables in all files except for images when copying
them from the skeleton directory. However, this may break PHP or perl scripts
which use the same format for variables as Virtualmin's template language. <p>

To avoid this problem, you can enter a list of file patterns in this field,
like <tt>*.php *.pl</tt>. Files matching those patterns will not have their
contents modified. <p>

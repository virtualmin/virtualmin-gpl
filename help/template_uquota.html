<header>Default quota for server administrator</header>

This option specifies the default disk usage quota for the server owner's Unix user account.  It will apply to files owned by the domain owner (probably all web content), email in the domain owners mailbox, and possibly other files within any sub-servers that may exist.  It may be overridden during creation or editing of the virtual server.<p>

<header>IPv6 address for restored servers</header>

This setting is only used when restoring a virtual server that does not
currently exist on the system. By default, Virtualmin will either assign it
the system's default shared IPv6 address if it was on a shared IP originally, or
use the private IPv6 address from the original system if it wasn't on a shared
address.
<p>

This works fine if your are moving a domain between two systems on the same
network, but if not the restored domain is not likely to be contactable via
the network. To avoid this, select the <b>Virtual with allocated IP</b> or
<b>Virtual with IP</b> option in this field, and Virtualmin will either select
a free IP for you, or use the one you enter. <p>

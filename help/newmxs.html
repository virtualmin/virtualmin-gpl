<header>Secondary Mail Servers</header>

A secondary mail server is one that can also receive email for one
of the virtual servers managed by Virtualmin, but only as a temporary
relay rather than the final destination. It is wise to setup a secondary
server for heavily used mail domains, to act as a backup or holding place
in case the primary mail server is down. <p>

On this page, you can select other servers with Virtualmin installed
to be used as secondary MX servers for new mail domains created on this
system. Before any servers will appear, they must first be added to the
Webmin Servers Index module, in which you must enter the root login and
password for the remote server. <p>

For each secondary mail server, you have the option of entering a different
hostname to use in the DNS MX record, instead of the server's actual hostname,
such as <i>secmx.yourdomain.com</i>. However, be sure that whatever you
enter is a valid DNS name that resolves to the same server. <p>

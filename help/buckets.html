<header>Amazon S3 Buckets</header>

<p>This page lists all the Amazon S3 buckets owned by S3 accounts that Virtualmin
is configured to use on the Cloud Storage Providers page. Buckets can
also be created and edited from this page, and the access control and
auto-deletion lifecycle rules that apply to files within them edited. <p>

Virtualmin's backup process will automatically create new buckets as required,
but in the default S3 storage location. Creating a bucket from this page allows
you to select a storage location that is closer to your Virtualmin system.

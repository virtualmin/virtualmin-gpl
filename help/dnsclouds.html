<header>Cloud DNS Providers</header>

This page allows you to configure Virtualmin to use DNS services other
than your own system. These typically provide higher availability and faster
DNS lookups to clients, for a cost per hosted domain. Once a provider has been
setup here, you can make it the default for new virtual servers on the 
Server Templates page. <p>

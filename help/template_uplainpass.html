<header>Store cleartext passwords?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, Virtualmin will store the clear text
passwords for domain owners and mailboxes. This allows them to be displayed in
the UI, but adds a potential security risk if your system is compromised. 
Selecting <b>No</b> will cause all new virtual servers created from this 
template to store only one-way hashed passwords instead. <p>
Since web applications need to store database passwords in plain text, the database password for a user
will be set to a new, random password if Virtualmin is set not to store cleartext passwords.  You can
view this password by going to <strong>Edit Databases &gt; Passwords</strong>. <p>

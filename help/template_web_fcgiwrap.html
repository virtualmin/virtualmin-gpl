<header>Run CGI scripts using</header>

When the <tt>fcgiwrap</tt> server is installed, this option allows you to select if it
will be always used to run CGI scripts for new domains. Otherwise, <tt>suexec</tt> will
be used if it is installed and configured correctly. <p>

FCGIwrap is generally faster to run CGI scripts, but requires that each virtual server run
its own server process which consumes additional RAM. <p>

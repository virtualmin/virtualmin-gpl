<header>PHP-FPM workload profile</header>

This option selects a set of tuned defaults for PHP-FPM process management.
It affects how many PHP-FPM worker processes are started, how many are kept
idle, and how much memory PHP-FPM is allowed to use. <p>

<b>Lean</b><br>
Uses the least memory. Keeps a smaller idle pool and uses a more conservative
memory budget. Best for small systems, low-traffic sites, and servers where
RAM is tight. <p>

<b>Balanced</b><br>
General-purpose defaults for most servers. Provides a reasonable idle pool and
a moderate memory budget. Recommended if you are not sure which profile to use.
This is the default profile. <p>

<b>Responsive</b><br>
Favors lower latency during bursts. Keeps more idle workers ready and starts
the pool warmer after restarts, reducing the chance of slow first requests.
Uses more memory than previous profiles. <p>

<b>Performance</b><br>
Favors throughput under sustained load. Allows more workers and keeps a larger
pool ready, which can increase concurrency and request capacity. This profile
can use significantly more RAM and is best for servers with ample memory. <p>

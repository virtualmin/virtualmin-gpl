<header>Request Let's Encrypt certificate at domain creation time?</header>

When enabled, Virtualmin will attempt to request a valid Let's
Encrypt SSL certificate for new virtual servers. This will only succeed
if they have a domain name which is resolvable from outside your system, so
that it can be looked up by the Let's Encrypt service. <p>

<header>Create TLSA DNS records for SSL certificates?</header>

When enabled, Virtualmin will add a TLSA DNS record for all hostnames
that use SSL certificates for newly created virtual servers. This allows
clients to validate that the SSL cert presented your webserver is the same
as the one hosted on your system, which prevents certain man-in-the-middle
attacks. <p>

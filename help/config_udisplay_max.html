<header>Maximum number of users to display</header>
<p>
You can control how many users are shown on the page at once using one of three
modes, and if there are more users than fit in the selected mode pagination and
search controls appear automatically.
</p>
<p>
The default "Unlimited" option shows all users on a single page, while the
"Paginate automatically" option chooses the page size based on the browser
window height, and the "Paginate with fixed page size" option shows a fixed
number of users on each page.

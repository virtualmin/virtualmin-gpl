<header>Default for sending email on renewal?</header>

This option determines the default email notification mode for SSL certificate
renewals for new virtual servers. You can select if the domain owner is notified
always, never, or only if renewal fails. You can also choose if the master
administrator will be notified as well. <p>

Note that these settings only control email messages sent by your Virtualmin
system. Certificate authorities (CAs) such as Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL may also
send their own renewal or expiry emails based on the contact details and
notification settings in your account with them. Those CA emails cannot be
configured or disabled from within Virtualmin. To change them, you must update
the notification options on your CA provider's website.

<header>Sub-path handling</header>

This option controls requests under the source path:
<ul>
<li><b>Keep sub-paths</b><br>
    Requests under the source path keep the same trailing path under the
    destination.
<li><b>Ignore sub-paths</b><br>
    Requests under the source path are redirected to the destination itself,
    without appending the trailing path.
<li><b>Only redirect exact source path</b><br>
    Only the exact source path is redirected.
</ul>

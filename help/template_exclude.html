<header>Directories to exclude from backups</header>

Virtual servers created from this template will by default exclude all
directories entered here from backups. This can be useful if you know that
all <a href="backup_exclude">your domains </a> will be running similar apps
or have similar content. Excluded directories can still be edited after
domain creation. <p>

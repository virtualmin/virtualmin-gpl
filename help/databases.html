<header>Edit Databases</header>

This page lists all databases owned by the virtual server and lets you create
new ones up to the limit for the logged-in user. You can also delete one or more
databases. <p>

To view a database's tables and data, click "Manage" button. If phpMyAdmin is
installed for this virtual server, you will also see a "Manage in phpMyAdmin"
button. If the virtual server is a sub-server and it has its own phpMyAdmin
install, that one is used instead of the parent's. If there is no per-server
install, but a system default phpMyAdmin has been set, that shared instance will
be used. <p>

To see additional details about a database, including its size and number of
tables, click its name.  <p>

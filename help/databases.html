<header>Edit Databases</header>

This page lists all databases owned by the virtual server and lets you create
new ones up to the limit for the logged-in user. You can also delete one or more
databases. <p>

To view a database's tables and data, click the "Manage" button. If phpMyAdmin
is installed for this virtual server, you will also see a "Manage in phpMyAdmin"
button. If phpMyAdmin is installed on a sub-server, the sub-server's phpMyAdmin
install is used instead of the parent's. <p>

To see additional details about a database, including its size and number of
tables, click its name.  <p>

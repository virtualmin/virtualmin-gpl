<header>Edit Databases</header>

This page lists all databases that are currently owned by the virtual server,
and allows the creation of addition databases up to any limit in force for
the user logged into Virtualmin. You can also delete one more databases
by selecting them from the list and hitting the <b>Delete Selected</b>
button. <p>

To view the actual tables and data in a database, click the <b>Manage</b>
link next to the database name in the table. To see the size of the database,
click on its name. <p>

When using Virtualmin Pro, two additional forms are shown below the database
list to change the login and password for the MySQL and PostgreSQL users
used by this virtual server. This can be useful if you want the database
login to be different from the primary administration login, perhaps for
security purposes. These should be changed with care, as any PHP scripts
(such as those from script installers) that have the username or password
in their configuration files will not be updated. <p>

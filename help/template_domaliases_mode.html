<header>Mail aliases for new domains</header>
 It is often useful to automatically create a number of aliases when a new domain is created.  For example, the RFC recommended "postmaster", "webmaster", "abuse", and "hostmaster" are all created by default by Virtualmin.  You may wish to add your own, for example, "support" or "bugs", or anything else, depending on the most likely user of the domains created from this template.

<header>Maximum alias servers</header>

This field allows you to impose a separate limit on the number of alias
virtual servers the reseller can create. You can set this and <b>Maximum
alias servers</b> to <b>Unlimited</b>, and set <b>Maximum non-alias servers</b>
to a lower number. This would allow the reseller to create as many alias
domains as he wants, while limiting the number of more resource-intensive
top-level and sub-servers. <p>
